**Hey!** I'm Daniel, a software engineer at Rippling where I'm focused on building compliance products that help businesses navigate complex regulatory landscapes. Feel free to reach out, I'd love to [connect](/contact)!

## Interests & Passions

### Finance & Economics
I have a deep fascination with financial markets and economic trends. I enjoy analyzing market dynamics, exploring investment strategies, and discussing economic theories. This interest drives me to understand the underlying human psychology that shapes these markets, what people truly value and the pursuit of happiness that ultimately drives our economy.

### Writing & Mental Models
I'm writing a book that reframes time and experience as our most meaningful resources. It explores practical mental models for appreciating, shaping, and carrying these resources forward so we can live with greater clarity, intention, and lasting impact.

### Photography & food
I shoot on a **Fujifilm X-T5** and keep structured **food reviews** and travel notes. They are part documentation, part design study: light, texture, and how spaces feel.
