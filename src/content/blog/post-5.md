As children, a summer day could stretch on forever. Now as an adult, I blink and another year is gone. I realized it is not my watch that races, but how I live those moments.

I notice this most when I lose myself doomscrolling through TikTok, Instagram reels, or YouTube memes. The content never ends. One short clip leads to the next until suddenly the day is gone. It feels like yesterday we celebrated the new year, and now 2025 is at least halfway done. Even crazier is 2025 is closer to 2050 than 2000! This surely can't be my imagination.

From what I have read, researchers connect it to the way adults experience less novelty and form fewer vivid memories. Our brains measure time more by new experiences than by the minutes on a clock. By contrast, new experiences give time weight. A weekend in a new city feels longer than a week at home. Learning something new, exploring a different neighborhood, or even noticing details in a familiar setting can stretch the sense of time. Psychologists call this the novelty effect. The brain records more when things are unfamiliar, which makes time feel slower and richer.

There is also the way we perceive time relative to our age. For a five-year-old, a year is twenty percent of their life. For a fifty-year-old, it is two percent. That difference in proportion explains why years feel longer in childhood and shorter as we grow older.

Slowing time is not about changing the clock. It is about changing how alive we feel inside it. The more novelty and awareness we bring into daily life, the more we stretch the moments we already have.

**Takeaway:** If time feels like it is slipping away, reduce passive scrolling and introduce something new. Even small changes in routine can make life feel longer and more vivid.
